        <p>first blog in the new blog folder using <a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/11ty-define-an-eleventy-11ty-collection-to-create-a-blog?pl=build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3">this blog collection approach by Stephanie Eckles at egghead.io</a></p>
<h2>result</h2>
<ul>
<li>the example was changed: posts becomes blogs because there's already a posts</li>
<li>blogs.md did not produce the list of clickable blog posts. Instead, a <code>pre code</code> was wrapped around all double handlebar syntax. When the extension was changed to html the corrrect output was displayed. Don't know why.</li>
