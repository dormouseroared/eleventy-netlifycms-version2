## tags

Trying to understand the way the `posts` folder is processed from input to output. 

The `posts.json` file seems to be adding `"tags: posts"` to every post so that a collection of "tags: posts" can be used to create a list of posts.

This was confirmed by adding displays of front matter to each post, using the layout post.njk.

`tags`, as well as `date`, are now displayed when a post in the post list is clicked.

Other front matter can also be shown... [TODO]

How to create a list of clickable unique tags... [TODO]

But, when adding tags to the front matter directly, the `posts` tag no longer appeared, and the post was absent from the posts list.

## searching

Just to note that this search was successful, and the results are understandable.

## Solving the problem

The `dot eleventy dot js` file was updated with the configuration change and the tags are now merged. Need to look out for when this approach is part of the mainline and the config change is not needed.
