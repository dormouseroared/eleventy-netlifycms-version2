title: setting up another blog to show a slightly different approach
---
first blog in the new blog folder using [this blog collection approach by Stephanie Eckles at egghead.io](https://egghead.io/lessons/11ty-define-an-eleventy-11ty-collection-to-create-a-blog?pl=build-an-eleventy-11ty-site-from-scratch-bfd3)

## result

* the example was changed: posts becomes blogs because there's already a posts
* blogs.md did not produce the list of clickable blog posts. Instead, a `pre code` was wrapped around all double handlebar syntax. When the extension was changed to html the corrrect output was displayed. Don't know why.
